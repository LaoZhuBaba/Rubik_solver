This is a Python learning project.  I started with no python skills and wanted to learn how to
use the language, particularly to gain some understanding of how to create a class from scratch.

Python's blessed library is required.  I have tested only on Linux but I believe that blessed
now works with Windows too.

I have made very little attempt to accommodate different terminal screen sizes so expect messy
results unless your terminal supports about 50 rows and a reasonably large number of
columns.
