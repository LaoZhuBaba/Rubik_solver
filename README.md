This is a Python learning project.  I started with no python and wanted to learn howo to use
the language, particularly with some understanding of OOP.

Python's blessed library is required.  I have tested only on Linux but I believe that blessed
now works with Windows too.

I have made very little attempt to accommodate different terminal screen sizes so expect messy
results if your terminal supports quite large number of rows and a reasonably large number of
columns.
